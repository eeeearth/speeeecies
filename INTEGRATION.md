# PR #93 review addendum

The Guttural toad source says males call throughout the year, with October and
November as the main breeding period. The record scopes its breeding phase to
South Africa (`ZA`) and uses those months for its croak season. The shared
`fsm-anuran-nocturnal-v1` program gates calling with one global month pair, so
`call_m1` and `call_m2` are now 10 and 11. The format cannot express a separate
schedule for each region; this setting represents the documented ZA main
breeding window wherever the shared program runs. Rain-driven and regional
variation remains outside the current model.

Suggested PR-body update:

> The shared anuran FSM now gates calls in October and November, matching the
> record's cited main breeding period and croak season. The source says calling
> can occur year-round; the FSM's single global month pair represents the
> record's ZA main breeding window because this format cannot encode regional
> call schedules.
